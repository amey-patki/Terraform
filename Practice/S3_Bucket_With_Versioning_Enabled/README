# Explanation:

1. Provider Configuration:

provider "aws": Specifies the AWS provider and the region to be used throughout the Terraform configuration.

2.S3 Bucket Creation:

resource "aws_s3_bucket": Defines the creation of an S3 bucket named "my-terraform-bucket."
bucket: Specifies the unique name for the S3 bucket.
acl: Sets the access control list (ACL) for the bucket to "private."

3.Versioning Configuration:

versioning: Specifies a block to enable versioning for the S3 bucket.
enabled = true: Enables versioning for the bucket.

4. Static Website Hosting Configuration:

website: Specifies a block to configure static website hosting for the S3 bucket.
index_document: Specifies the default index document for the website (e.g., "index.html").
error_document: Specifies the error document for the website (e.g., "error.html").

In summary, this Terraform script not only creates an S3 bucket with versioning enabled but also configures it as a static website.
The index.html file will be served as the default document, and the error.html file will be displayed in case of errors.
 This is useful for hosting static websites directly from an S3 bucket.
